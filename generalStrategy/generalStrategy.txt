My default is to use 
    1.rems for font sizes,
    2.pixels for borders,(to get a nice thin line)
    3.ems for most other measures, especially paddings, margins, and border radius (think of adjusting margins,paddings,border-radius,etc relative to the font size)
    4.percentages for container widths when necessary.
